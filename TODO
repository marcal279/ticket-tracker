    ASK SIR:
        Use Device Emulator for window size [1366 x 625]
        Should observables be unsubscribed from in onDestroy
        Next Index try to store from Dash or TickManager || Pending meeting with Barco sir
        How to wait for an observable to load and then perform actions
        what is the sorcery behind ngrx selectors?????
        Good video/site to learn ngrx
        Any features I should add in this
        Ever used Firebase? What are their db rules protocol?

    Improvements:
        Each COPE needs to be manually reset/changed for any update. Integrate to single platform?
        Each COPE also requires internet connection for Free To Watch channels every 7 days
        GPS for wach COPE removed due to costs

        COPE can provide service to any number of set top boxes
        2 manufacturers for COPEs: Dexin and Gospel; Dexin is better, both are CHINA based
        CHINA manufacturers all boards, including MUXes, Set Top Boxes
        3 vendors for COPEs: Saima (East dominant, Gospel provider), MCBS (North dominant, Dexin provider) and Spike (Mh and south); Spike is new player
